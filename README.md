## About <a name = "about"></a>

<h3 align="center"> In this project, I built the Mastermind game by using ruby. The main goal is to put into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming. Particularly, classes and access to their attributes.</h3>

- If you want to play it online, visit [this repl link](https://repl.it/@SafaErden/Mastermind) to reach and play my Masterming game online.

<h2>How to start the game?</h2>

1- download this repository

2- unpack it (winrar recommended)

3- copy its address from your download path

4- open your terminal commandline (powershell in my case)

5- write "cd" and put the address of the game folder

6- now, to run the game, type 'ruby ./lib/mastermind.rb'

7- Have fun!

<h2>Rules</h2>

You probably already know how to play Mastermind. If you do not know how to play it, please [visit this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that the mastermind isn't quite as simple as you think!

How to Play it...

1. When you run the game, enter a size for the game, this will produce a secret string including the letters R resresenting RED, G representing GREEN, B representing BLUE and Y representing YELLOW containin the number of characters that you enter.

2. Then begin to guess the secret string using the letters R, G, B and Y like 'RRGBY' if you set the size of the game equal to 5.

3. After each guess you will be informed about your exact and near matches.

4. If you can find the secret string, you win!
